## 🤖 AI-Powered Insurance Claims Processing & Fraud Detection System

**ClaimAI** is an AI-driven insurance claims automation platform designed to streamline claim evaluation, improve fraud detection accuracy, and accelerate decision-making.
The system integrates **computer vision, machine learning, and intelligent workflow automation** to assist claim adjusters from submission through approval or denial.

---

## 🚀 What This System Does

ClaimAI enhances insurance claim processing by:

* **Damage Assessment via AI Vision**
  Analyzes uploaded claim photos to estimate damage severity and potential repair costs.

* **Fraud Risk Detection**
  Applies multi-model machine learning techniques and pattern analysis to identify suspicious claims.

* **Automated Documentation**
  Generates professional approval letters, denial notices, and claim reports automatically.

* **Decision Support Intelligence**
  Provides actionable recommendations using real-time data insights and predictive analytics.

## ⚙️ End-to-End Workflow

The platform manages the full claim lifecycle:

1. Claim submission and document upload
2. Image analysis and damage estimation
3. Fraud risk scoring and validation checks
4. AI-driven recommendations
5. Automated approval/denial communication

---

## Key Features

### Intelligent Damage Assessment
I integrated both OpenAI's Vision API and a custom YOLOv8 model to analyze vehicle damage photos. The system:
- Identifies specific damaged parts (bumper, hood, doors, etc.)
- Estimates repair costs per component
- Provides detailed breakdowns of parts, labor, and materials
- Uses historical repair data (RAG) for accurate cost estimation

### Real-Time Fraud Detection
The fraud detection engine performs multi-layered analysis:
- Compares claimed amounts against actual damage estimates
- Checks for suspicious patterns (over-claiming, under-claiming, missing evidence)
- Validates policy coverage ratios
- Analyzes historical claim patterns using XGBoost ML models
- Auto-generates detailed denial reasons when fraud is detected

### Streamlined Workflow
I designed a step-by-step interface that mirrors how adjusters actually work:
1. **Select Claim** - Click any claim from the queue to auto-load details
2. **Analyze Damage** - Process photos to get detailed cost breakdowns
3. **Calculate Fraud Risk** - Real-time assessment with clear recommendations
4. **Make Decision** - Generate approval letters or rejection emails

### Professional Document Generation
The system automatically creates:
- **Approval Letters** with settlement breakdowns and payment timelines
- **Rejection Emails** with specific fraud indicators and appeal information

## Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- Gradio for the interactive web interface
- Real-time image gallery and data visualization

**Backend & AI:**
- FastAPI for API services
- OpenAI Vision API (gpt-4o-mini) for damage analysis
- Custom YOLOv8 Nano model for fast, local damage detection
- XGBoost for fraud classification
- RAG system with historical repair cost database

**Data Storage:**
- PostgreSQL for claims, policies, and fraud scores (15,420 records)
- File system for damage evidence images (20,551 images from Roboflow dataset)

## How It Works

### 1. Damage Analysis with RAG

When analyzing damage photos, I don't just rely on AI vision alone. I built a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that:
- Retrieves historical repair costs from a knowledge base
- Matches detected damage types to real repair scenarios
- Provides accurate cost estimates based on actual data
- Includes repair timelines and recommendations

### 2. Intelligent Fraud Detection

The fraud detection goes beyond pre-calculated scores. I implemented real-time checks that:
- Compare what the claimant says the damage costs versus what the AI actually finds
- Flag suspicious patterns like claiming near maximum coverage
- Check evidence quality (missing photos, suspicious image counts)
- Auto-generate detailed denial reasons with specific fraud indicators

### 3. One-Click Workflow

I designed the interface to be as efficient as possible:
- Click any claim in the table to instantly load all details
- All images display immediately in a gallery
- Action buttons are clearly labeled with what they do
- Results update in real-time as you progress through steps

## Key Datasets

**Insurance Claims Data:**
- Source: Kaggle Insurance Fraud Detection Dataset
- Records: 15,420 real insurance claims with fraud labels
- Features: 33 attributes including claim amount, incident details, policy info

**Vehicle Damage Images:**
- Source: Roboflow Car Damage Dataset
- Images: 312 annotated vehicle damage photos
- Categories: 6 damage types (dent, scratch, broken glass, front/rear/side damage)
- Split: Training, validation, and test sets

---

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/claimAI

# Optional
OPENAI_VISION_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # For cost optimization
MAX_CLAIMS_PER_DAY=1000          # Rate limiting
```

---

## Development

I structured the code to be maintainable and extensible:

- **Models** (`app/models/`) - Database schemas using SQLAlchemy
- **Services** (`app/services/`) - Business logic separated from UI
- **Scripts** (`scripts/`) - One-time setup and data loading utilities

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Code Style

```bash
black app/
isort app/
```

## Cost Optimization

I designed this to run affordably:

- **OpenAI Vision**: ~$0.0006 per image (gpt-4o-mini)
- **Custom YOLO**: Free local inference (~50ms per image)
- **Caching**: All AI responses cached to avoid repeat API calls
- **Estimated monthly cost**: $20-30 for moderate usage

To further reduce costs:
- Use Custom YOLO instead of OpenAI Vision where possible
- Implement aggressive caching strategies
- Batch process claims during off-peak hours

---

## Future Improvements

Areas I'm planning to enhance:
- Real-time video damage analysis
- Integration with Neo4j for fraud network detection
- Mobile app for field adjusters
- Multi-language support for global deployment
- Advanced analytics dashboard with fraud trend visualization
